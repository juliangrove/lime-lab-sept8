* Motivation
** Big question
   How should we use inference datasets to test semantic theories?

   #+beamer: \pause \bigskip
   *A couple of sub-questions*:
   #+beamer: \pause
   #+attr_beamer: :overlay <+->
   - How do we get at ``true'' inference judgments? (Judgment data tends to be
     influenced by non-semantic factors, e.g., participant response strategies,
     accuracy).
   - How do we interpret inference data?
     - Do we compare mean responses among conditions? If so, what do such means
       tell us?
     - Do we somehow take into account the whole response distribution?

** This talk
   We will do a few things:
   #+beamer: \pause
   #+attr_beamer: :overlay <+->
   - We will look at particular empirical domain: factive inferences.
   - We will develop a compositional probabilistic semantics that allows us to
     formulate Bayesian models of inference data (following
     [cite/t:@grove_probabilistic_2023]).
   - We will use this semantics to /combine/ theories of factivity with linking
     assumptions seamlessly.  

* Factivity and gradience
